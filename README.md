### About
Sunday is an ambitious project to create the missing piece in the Nim ecosystem: a modern, good-looking, and easy-to-use publishing platform for indie developers, bloggers and content creators. Sunday will use the power of Nim, as a compiled language, to deliver a fast and efficient experience for both users and developers. With a focus on simplicity, extensibility (via runtime shared libraries) and performance (low memory footprint and cpu usage)

### Development

> [!NOTE]
> Documentation is still a work in progress, many details are not yet documented, are incomplete or may be outdated.

#### Backend Development
If you want to contribute to Sunday, you must ensure you have [Nim installed](https://nim-lang.org/install.html) on your machine. Once installed, you can use Nimble, Nim's package manager to install and build Sunday:

Nimble will try install the latest stable version of Sunday
```
nimble install sunday
```

If you need the bleeding edge version, you can specifyi `#head` to install directly from the main branch on GitHub:
```
nimble install sunday@#head
```

Sunday is powered by the [Supranim web framework](https://github.com/supranim/supranim), so if you want to contribute to the core of Sunday, you should also familiarize yourself with Supranim and its architecture. Check out the [Sunday Documentation](https://docs.supranim.com) for more details on how to set up a development environment and contribute to the project.

#### Client Side Development
Currently, Sunday uses the npm package manager to manage client-side dependencies and Rollup as the module bundler. 

To build and watch for changes while developing the client-side code, you can run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```
npm run watch
```

To build the client-side code for production, you can run:
```
npm run build
```
